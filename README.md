To Deploy the website please download the repository or download the latest release (Final-Release-1) to download the complete source code and launch index.html which takes you to the main login page and from there the rest of the website can be navigated through the inputs of the user.

Alternatively, you could also visit https://frazer-bass.github.io/ to access the website.

You should not need to open any other html files and can navigate to those pages from the main index.html however if you would like to launch individual pages you can also launch these through their own respective .html files.
